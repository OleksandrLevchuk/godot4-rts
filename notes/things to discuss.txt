	i made a couple structural changes to the project. in the past every node script was external as a file in the project folder. Now i decided to gradually convert the scripts to be built-in into the scenes, so the project file structure doesn't have to mirror the node structure. The nodes seem to be sufficient for carrying all kinds of things, and the only drawback of this approach that i see is that .tscn files are harder to edit in an external code editor, which is a non-issue for me. The upside is that the project logic and code base can be broken up into many more modular pieces, hopefully making the code more readable.
