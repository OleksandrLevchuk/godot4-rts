	change the tank orientation as it moves

var todo = "
	make some visual at the point you click, where the tank heads to
	now there's only a drag selection. implement a single unit selection too
	instead of a constant speed, make the tank accelerate gradually, with reduced turn rate at high speeds
	deal with that terrible aliasing, like wtf
	try to make a photoshop like navigation in godot
	make the tank turret separate for future animations
	look into pathfinding...
	maybe precalculate destinations of units in moving groups
