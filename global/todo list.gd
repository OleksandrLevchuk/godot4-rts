#		DONE:
#	change the tank orientation as it moves
#	make some visual at the point you click, where the tank heads to
#	optimize the way the select box sends a signal to the world node indirectly through the ui node
#	fix the tank trembling when going in a straight line
###########################################################
#		TO DO:
#	fix the tank forever trying to go through walls
#	teach the tank to drive in reverse - this will require route precalculation to decide whether moving backwards is worth the time
#	fix the tank sometimes flipping instantly when ordered to go slightly backwards
#	fix the tank running circles when the target is too close
#	organize the fking project folder, maybe put scripts into a separate one
#	i want triangular selection boxes
#	i want some verticality
#	as of now, there's only a drag selection. implement a single unit selection too
#	instead of a constant speed, make the tank accelerate gradually, with reduced turn rate at high speeds
#	deal with that terrible aliasing, like wtf. docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/2d/2d_antialiasing.html
#	try to make a photoshop like navigation in godot
#	make the tank turret separate for future animations
#	look into pathfinding...
#	maybe precalculate destinations of units in moving groups, try making a visual aid first
